# Graduate course in Machine Learning - Assignments (Ryerson University)

This repository represents the 3 assignments done in the graduate course at Ryerson University through the Computer Science department. 

### Assignment 1: 
-Question 1: Linear Regression on k-degree polynimials. Gradient Descent and Schocastic Gradient Descent performance comparison. 
Assignment dives deep dive into understanding the learning rate.
-Question 2: Logistic Regression and understanding of the decision boundaries. Deep dive into the number of iterations. Understanding between computation cost and reward of increasing number of iterations. 
*All algorithms coded from scratch as ML specific libraries were not allowed for the assginment.

### Assignment 2: 
-Question 1: Understanding the difference between Logistic Regression and Gaussian Discriminal Analysis (GDA) Algorithm for binary classification. 
-Question 2: Exploring Poisson Regression, a GLM (Generalized Linear Model) part of the exponential model family. 
-Question 3: Building a spam classifier using Naive Bayes Algorithm and SVM (Support Vector Machine). Comparing the performance of both algorithms. 
*All algorithms coded from scratch as ML specific libraries were not allowed for the assginment

### Assignment 3: 
-Question 1: Implement a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Compare regularized vs. non-regularized model performance. 
-Question 2: Implement a simple Neural Network to perform binary classification.
*All algorithms coded from scratch as ML specific libraries were not allowed for the assginment
